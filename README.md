## <p id="general_info">General Info</p>
The main aim of the project is to develop a web-based application that is going to make it possible for the customer to place an order of food by using this app .

In this we are also creating food recommendation app and that will substitute the manual system of the placing an order  with an automated one.

There is a separate module where each task that was identified as necessary in order to successfully develop the Food Web App or Food Ordering WebApp is presented and described in detail
- This project aims to create two interfaces that is Customer, Admin
- User Interface- Used to create an interface where the Customer can place orders, review etc
- Admin Interface- Used to create an interface where the Admin can add the food products,modify it,delete the food product
- It also provide good authentication so that the legitimate user can use this app
- Backend using Mongodb

At present, only the frontend and Backend of the website has been developed, which consists of the landing page,sign-in and sign-up and cart and product description page.

## <p id="features_for_future">Features to implement in future:</p>
- Recommendation System using UnSupervised Learning
- Payment Gateway to be established.
- GPS tracking need to be done.
- Google ,Facebook OAuthentication 

## <p id="tech">Tech Stack Used:</p>
- HTML
- CSS
- Mongodb
- JavaScript
- Jquery
- ReactJs
- ExpressJs
- NodeJs

## <p id="prerequisites">Prerequisite to run the project in your desktop</p>
It is recommended that your laptop should have the following specifications in order to run this project:
- NodeJs

- git

## <p id="steps">Steps to run the project:</p>
1. Clone the project using git clone command in terminal
   - ```git clone https://github.com/VGandhi27/FoodWebApp.git ```
2. Open the FoodWebApp folder in Visual Studio Code (or any other IDE)
3. In the terminal section of the Visual Studio Code run the following command 
   - ```npm i``` - It will install all the node modules/libraries to run this WebApp 
4. Now run the following command
   - ``` cd server npm start``` - It will start the server
   - ``` cd client npm start``` - It will host the project in to a local server

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
